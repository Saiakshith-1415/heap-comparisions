# heap-comparisions
These programs implement Binary, Binomial, Fibonacci, and Skew Heaps to compare their efficiency in insertion, deletion, and merging. Each uses distinct structures—array or tree-based—to maintain heap properties. Menu-driven interaction shows how structure impacts speed, memory, and performance.
